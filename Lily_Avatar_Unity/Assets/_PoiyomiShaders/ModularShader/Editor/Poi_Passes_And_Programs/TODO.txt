- removed debug texture from decal video because you can now test in avatar projects with audio link. I need to add support for audio link video uv's (soon)
- removed non function experimental fur shader that was accidentally included in the last build

* AudioLink options for Rim Lighting are no longer exposed when set to UTS2 or LilToon as of 9.0.47. It's only exposed when using Poiyomi Style.
* Point light passthrough for same as base
* Theme colors don't use oklab
* Add more control the the linear emission glitter ramp up as well as density

Was experimenting with Two Pass, found that POI_PASS_BASE/POI_PASS_ADD (and accompanying multi_compile_fwdbase etc) are not defined in the secondary passes.
Meanwhile some modules use those define instead of UNITY_PASS_*
Don't know if intentional but doubt it.

# 9.1.6
* Fixed Dissolved Color was not properly using themes or AL when locked in.
* The video debug texture for decals was causing issue on lockin and I had to remove it. (If the texture slot wasn't filled in the video would never show up)

Don't know how to fix
decal depth uv0 only (uses tangents which are generated from uv0)

post 9.0
* Use Luminance for Min Brightness when using Realistic Lighting
* use depth to move skirt out of leg geometry
* matcap spritesheet
* truchet thickness audio link
* outline grabpass with pixelation
* internal parallax no global mask
* internal parallax no way to use it as emission and it shows in the dark by default
* LTCGI
* fur
* add a no special uv toggle to decals
* scrolling emission offset by uv x or y
* UV glitching for textures
* screenspace ao in base pass
* plane uv better pano effects including fresnel effects and depth
* Paralax write to depth
* normal shadows https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/filamented/-/blob/master/Filamented/SharedNormalShadowLib.hlsl?ref_type=heads
* take a look at the gem cloth aniso
* 3d noise R&D
* voronoi mask
* Video player stuff uniform Texture2D _Udon_VideoTex; exists if >16px
